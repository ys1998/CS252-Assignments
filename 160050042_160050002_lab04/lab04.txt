Exercise 1
--------------
1. 	~/ns-3.27/examples/wireless/wifi-simple-infra.cc which is copied to ~/ns-3.27/scratch

2.      wifi-simple-infra-0-0.pcap
	wifi-simple-infra-1-0.pcap

3. 	Beacon frame & payload frame

4.	./waf --run "wifi-simple-infra --rss=-97 --numPackets=20 --verbose=true"

Exercise 2
--------------
1.	Direction : Packets are being transmitted from STA0 (IP address 10.0.0.2) to AP (IP address 10.0.0.1). It is easy to determine from the code since the base address is first assigned to 10.0.0.0 and then IPs for AP and STA0 are assigned subsequently (because of which they are assigned IPs 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 respectively). The source and destination addresses from the .pcap file match these values, with the source as STA0 and destination as AP.
	Rate : From the code, application layer data rate should be 100 Mbps; from the .pcap file, physical layer data rate was found to be 65 Mbps. 
	Packet size : The payload size is found to be 1472 bytes in both the code and .pcap file. The frame size in .pcap file was found to be 1574 bytes.
	
2.	The throughput mentioned in the output file is ~59 Mbps (values for the simulations are 54.8408, 59.5395, 59.5512, 59.563 and 59.4924 Mbps).

3.	Payload (wrt Application layer) = 1472 bytes
	Time taken for transmitting a packet (obtained from timestamps of successive packets) = 190 microseconds
	Effective data rate for Application layer = 1472*8/190 Mbps = 61.97 Mbps

4.	PHY layer data rate is 65 Mbps.

5.	Data size = 1472 bytes
	UDP header = 8 bytes
	IP header = 20 bytes
	802.11 MAC header = 34 bytes
	Total data size = 1534 bytes
	PHY layer header = 20 microseconds
	PHY layer data rate (HTMCS7 standard) = 65 Mbps
	Effective throughput = 1534*8/(1534*8/65 + 20) Mbps = 58.77 Mbps

	This matches the obtained values. (~59 Mbps)

6.	Real time = 10.783s; This difference arises because some time is required to get things up and running, and initiate the simulations.

Exercise 3
--------------
1. As per TA, kept data-rate = 10 Mbps

In initial stage, the throughput increases with increase in client due to link layer speed as 60 Mbps while datarate at 10Mbps.

Now after a moment, then the graph dips fastly in the begining and then the throughput keeps on decreasing.

Within the limited resources available, we searched upto 100 nodes and the throughput kept on decreasing.

2. Fairness decreases with increase in the number of nodes. This is a constantly decreasing graph within marginal error at some instances as fluctuation but at rest the garph remains a decreasing graph.

3. In general we assumed that for 10 second interval, we calculated the per-sec Jain fairness averaged out over all the seconds.

This will remain quite same to the original 1-sec value but with a very little fluctuation and remains a costantly decreasing graph.


Exercise 4
--------------
1. Taken the data-rate as 10Mbps according to announcement, in the begining the %tage error was zero for one client and then increases for 2 client. After that there was a decrease in the amount of collision for a given station taken as station 1 in our case due to number of total packet transmitted beign increasing.

But after then, when we reach the total capacity of physical link, then mostly the percentage error keep increasing after that limit within the marginal error of variation possible. But mainly it increases with increase in n.

2. For N as  1 , the graph of distribution is more concentrated at smaller values.

In a mid value, the graph had some high values too with low probability, but mainly still the value was concentrated at a point with higher probability.

In largest value, There was a relatively larger spread in the inter-arrival time and the peak was the at largest time innterval among all 3 also the maximum value attend was pretty high.
