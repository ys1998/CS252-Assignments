Exercise 2
----------
1. Our machine's hostnames were 'arch' and 'R2D2'. We found them by executing the 'hostname' command. Our machine's IP addresses were '10.196.19.32' and '192.168.42.28'. We found them by executing the 'ifconfig' command and checking the 'inet' address field.
2. The next hop's IP address (or the _gateway address) was 10.196.0.2 and the MAC address was 00:04:96:83:a0:8e. Both of these were found by executing 'arp -a' command and looking against the _gateway field.
3. The DNS server's hostname is 'nameserver' and its IP address is '10.200.1.11'. This was obtained by looking at the /etc/resolv.conf file.
4. The numbers in /etc/protocols denote the Protocol Numbers for different protocols as assigned by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). They are used for multiplexing/demultiplexing between the transport and network layers.
5. This information is obtained from the /etc/services file. The required port numbers are: ssh - 22, ftp - 21, nfs - 2049 and smtp - 25. 





Exercise 3
----------
1.
sudo tcpdump -w outnetwork #outnetwork is the filename

Simultaneously running this in other terminal
wget internet.iitb.ac.in

Then opened sniffed result in Wireshark

2.
Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 43104, Dst Port:80, Seq: 0, Len: 0
.
.
Windows size value: 29200
Checksum: 0xea60 [unverified]

Source 192.168.42.28
Destination 10.102.1.11

a) MAC fe:45:77:3c:34:1f 
	It was determined by looking at the TCP packet captured unbulletder Ethernet II
layer header (link layer detail).
  IP address of next layer 192.168.42.129
	found through 
> traceroute iitb.ac.in

b) Final destination 10.102.1.11
	In the detail of Internet Protocol Version 4 HEADER (Transport layer). Destination bullet of the details in header

We can't find MAC address of destination as we don't have packet of node after our system.  

c) In Ethernet/Link layer there is a Type field which gives the information of the further layer to refer to.
	Type: IPv4(0x0800)
In IPv4 layer,
	Protocol: TCP (6)
In TCP header,
	Source Port: 43104
	Destination Port: 80
So at destination Port 80 is used

3) exercise3.pcap is attached




Exercise 4
----------

sudo tcpdump -w second-task

Simultaneously running this in other terminal
ping www.internet.iitb.ac.in # this generates both ICMP and arp

ssh rupesh@mars.cse.iitb.ac.in # this generates SSH packets

Q2 
a) Ethernet II -> Address Resolution Protocol(request)
Link layer 
	Ethernet II 

Network : Address Resolution Protocol(request)
	Protocol type: IPv4 (0x0800)
	Hardware type: Ethernet (1)

b) Type: ARP (0x0806) in Ethernet Header


Q3. ICMP protocol: 

a) Ethernet II -> Internet Protocol Version 4 -> Internet Control Message Protocol


Type: 8 (Echo (ping) request) There is no port associated with ICMP

b) Type: IPv4 (0x0800)   #in decimals 2048

c) Protocol: ICMP (1)


Q4.
 a) Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: 192.168.42.28, Dst: 10.129.3.5
Source- 192.168.42.28
Destination- 10.129.3.5
