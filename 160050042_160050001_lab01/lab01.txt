Exercise 2
----------
1. Our machine's hostnames were 'arch' and 'R2D2'. We found them by executing the 'hostname' command. Our machine's IP addresses were '10.196.19.32' and '192.168.42.28'. We found them by executing the 'ifconfig' command and checking the 'inet' address field.
2. The next hop's IP address (or the _gateway address) was 10.196.0.2 and the MAC address was 00:04:96:83:a0:8e. Both of these were found by executing 'arp -a' command and looking against the _gateway field.
3. The DNS server's hostname is 'nameserver' and its IP address is '10.200.1.11'. This was obtained by looking at the /etc/resolv.conf file.
4. The numbers in /etc/protocols denote the Protocol Numbers for different protocols as assigned by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). They are used for multiplexing/demultiplexing between the transport and network layers.
5. This information is obtained from the /etc/services file. The required port numbers are: ssh - 22, ftp - 21, nfs - 2049 and smtp - 25.





Exercise 3
----------
1.
sudo tcpdump -w outnetwork #outnetwork is the filename

Simultaneously running this in other terminal
wget internet.iitb.ac.in

Then opened sniffed result in Wireshark

2.
Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 43104, Dst Port:80, Seq: 0, Len: 0
.
.
Windows size value: 29200
Checksum: 0xea60 [unverified]

Source 192.168.42.28
Destination 10.102.1.11

a) MAC fe:45:77:3c:34:1f
	It was determined by looking at the TCP packet captured under bullet Ethernet II
layer header (link layer detail).
  IP address of next layer 192.168.42.129
	found through
> traceroute iitb.ac.in

b) Final destination 10.102.1.11
	In the detail of Internet Protocol Version 4 HEADER (Transport layer). Destination bullet of the details in header

We can't find MAC address of destination as we don't have packets of nodes beyond our system.

c) In Ethernet/Link layer there is a Type field which gives the information of the further layer to refer to.
	Type: IPv4(0x0800) #in decimals 2048
In IPv4 layer,
	Protocol: TCP (6)
In TCP header,
	Source Port: 43104
	Destination Port: 80
So at destination Port 80 is used

3) exercise3.pcap is attached




Exercise 4
----------

sudo tcpdump -w second-task

Simultaneously running this in other terminal
ping www.internet.iitb.ac.in # this generates both ICMP and arp

ssh rupesh@mars.cse.iitb.ac.in # this generates SSH packets

Q2
a) The flow of this packet up the protocol stack is : Ethernet II -> Address Resolution Protocol(request)

The processes/protocols handling this packet are :
In Link layer 
    Ethernet II 

In Network layer :

    Address Resolution Protocol(request)
    Protocol type: IPv4 (0x0800)

b) Type: ARP (0x0806) in Ethernet Header #in decimals 2054


Q3. ICMP protocol:

a) The flow of the packet is : Ethernet II -> Internet Protocol Version 4 -> Internet Control Message Protocol

Processes handling this packet are :
Type: 8 (Echo (ping) request) (There is no port associated with ICMP)

b) Type: IPv4 (0x0800)   #in decimals 2048

c) Protocol: ICMP (1)


Q4.
 a) Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: 192.168.42.28, Dst: 10.129.3.5
Source- 192.168.42.28
Destination- 10.129.3.5
b) Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 50352, Dst Port: 22, Seq: 1, Ack: 1, Len: 41
Source Port 50352
Destination Port 22

c) ssh server works on port number 22 using both tcp and udp as specified in the output of 
$> cat /etc/services | grep "ssh"

ssh		22/tcp				# SSH Remote Login Protocol
ssh		22/udp
 



Exercise 5
----------
1) The HTTP request is sent at a moment from wget and in response of the request, 
a MP4 containing HTTP is recieved by the system. 
wget takes this difference as a measure of X, Y and Z

2) 11.2 MB/s which translates to 89.6 Mbps
I am connected to a 100Mbps link

3 and 4) 
	For Ping, time is calculated as the difference in between ICMP request packet and ICMP reply packet.
